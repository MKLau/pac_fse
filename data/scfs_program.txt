# SCFS Course Descriptions

SCFS Core Courses are designed to develop a systemic and multi-disciplinary understanding of the food system. Students study the history and development of agri-food systems, regionally, nationally and globally and its impacts on global environmental quality, human health and social and economic well-being. Pressing ecological and social issues in agriculture are addressed along with conceptions of ecological sustainability and social justice in the food system. Students develop a deep understanding of the most up-to-date scholarship in the transdisciplinary field of agricultural ecology and the political economy of the US and global agri-food system. The SCFS curriculum emphasizes the integration of theoretical knowledge with experiential and hands-on learning of sustainable agriculture practices in the field. Students also study a range of pressing ethical issues in food, agriculture and the environment in order to help them make more clear and ethically determined judgments. Details of each SCFS course can be found in the descriptions below.




SCFS 300 Survey of Sustainable Community Food Systems of Hawaiʻi
This course provides a multi-disciplinary analysis of the food and farming systems of Hawai’i. Drawing extensively from selected texts and the experiences of food systems professionals, the course examines the historical forces shaping the food and agricultural systems of Hawaiʻi, evaluates key examples of sustainable community food and agriculture initiatives in Honolulu County and the State, and identifies the key social, economic and political obstacles to the scaling of a more ecologically sustainable and socially equitable food and agriculture system for Hawaiʻi.
