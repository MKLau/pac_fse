LO1: Analyze Food Systems Using a Transdisciplinary Approach Guided by Sustainability Principles
Students learn to apply systems thinking to food systems—considering the complex interactions from production to waste—through a holistic and pluralistic lens. This means recognizing interconnected social, ecological, cultural, and health dimensions and valuing diverse perspectives, especially from those impacted by food systems. The approach is transdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from across and beyond academic disciplines. The goal is to develop rich, multi-voiced, often visual representations (like rich pictures or concept maps) that reflect the complexity, dynamics, and sustainability challenges of real-world food systems.
LO2: Critically Reflect on Interactions Between Worldviews and Power Relations in Food Systems, Recognizing One’s Positionality and Learning Processes
Students develop critical reflection as a core skill to navigate the complexity of food systems by questioning assumptions, examining how knowledge is shaped by personal and cultural perspectives, and recognizing power dynamics. This outcome emphasizes understanding one’s positionality and how learning is socially constructed. It prepares students to engage with diverse viewpoints, unpack systemic inequalities, and make informed, ethical decisions. Through reflective writing, dialogue, and community-based learning, students build the mindset needed to address complex and often contentious sustainability challenges.
LO 3: Apply Appropriate Methodologies Considering Diverse Ways of Knowing
Students are expected to choose and apply research methods that incorporate multiple ways of knowing—academic and non-academic, including Indigenous, cultural, and community-based knowledge systems. This outcome emphasizes inclusive, evidence-based inquiry that respects diverse epistemologies. Methods may include experiments, interviews, storytelling, and ceremonies. The goal is to create well-rounded, decolonizing food system solutions, while reflecting on positionality and biases.

LO 4: Demonstrate Practical Skills in the Food System Based on Sustainability Principles
This outcome emphasizes hands-on learning to develop skills across the food system—from farming and culinary arts to research, policy, and communication. Students engage in experiential learning to understand food system logistics and apply sustainability principles in real-life scenarios. Activities like farming, internships, and problem-based learning help students build, apply, and evaluate these skills effectively.

LO 5: Communicate Effectively in Oral, Written, and Visual Formats Across Multiple Contexts
Students must be able to express complex ideas clearly and persuasively across diverse audiences and formats. Effective communication includes cross-cultural competence, adaptability, and storytelling, using oral, written, and visual tools. SFS programs emphasize communication as a key to leadership, knowledge sharing, and collaborative problem-solving, with activities like reflective writing, participatory writing, and presentations.

LO 6: Collaborate and Demonstrate Leadership Skills and Professionalism as Inclusive Members of Diverse Teams
This outcome focuses on developing students’ ability to lead, facilitate, and contribute meaningfully in diverse teams. Collaboration is central to solving food system challenges and requires communication, professionalism, and mutual respect. Curriculum includes team-based projects, internships, and interactive techniques that promote collective action and inclusivity.

LO 7: Co-design, Implement, and Assess Food System Solutions Across Scales
Building on earlier LOs, this outcome involves using systems thinking to develop, apply, and evaluate sustainability solutions in real-world contexts. Students must co-design projects with stakeholders, communicate across disciplines, and assess outcomes using appropriate tools. Activities often include participatory research, service learning, and capstone projects aimed at addressing complex, multi-scale food system issues collaboratively.
